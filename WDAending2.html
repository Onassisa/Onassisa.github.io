<h1>Location: ???</h1>

<p1>Against your better judgement stay put and wait, "Maybe they'll all just go away" you think to yourself trying to rationalize your foolish choice...The eyes all turn to look at you no matter where you move, where you go they follow, it's too late to run as you see darker shadows envelope the room edging closer to you. The shadows wrap around you comsuming every part of your being. It's slow, yet you don't feel pain; you can't breath, yet your mind is calm, foreign thoughts invade your mind as the shadows infiltrate every orifice in your body,"<span class="Evil">You will be apart of us soon</span>" Though you shouldn't, given whats happening to you, you take comfort in those words as your mind slips into the void <span class="Evil">We are now one, and nothing will keep us apart</span></p1>
