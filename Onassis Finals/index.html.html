    <h1>An "Angle’s" Descent</h1>
    <h2>By Onassis Alberto</h2>
    <p>This story is about a false angle that tricks everyone and brings chaos to the world. It even has the tower of babel in it(although it's not drawn well). I made it because It poped into my head while I was playing a religious adjacent game, and it seemed easy. It's not related to any political/social cause. I guess the message would be that not all things/people that seem good are good.</p>
