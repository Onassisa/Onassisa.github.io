<p>You look at the painting and and your eyes are immediately drawned to the woman in it. For some reason you can't make up her face and the other figure in the painting seems to be missing...just then you feel a presence behind you, with every fiber of your body telling you not to look back, catching a glimps of the figure in the mirror you close your eyes and begin chanting in the hopes to exorcise the sprit.</p>

<p>"<span class="Evil">Huh?, can't look at the face of your victim</span>"</p>

<p>*You keep chanting*</p>

<p>"<span class="Evil">Chant all you want Im not going anywhere</span>"</p>
