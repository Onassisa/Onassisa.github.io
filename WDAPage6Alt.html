<h1>Location: Room</h1>

<p>You run, and run, and run, but no matter how far you run you can't escape them, but you don't relent you keep moving until your vision blurs and you blackout. Your eyes open and your leaning against a wall with no memory on how you got there, a dream perhaps? does't matter what does is that your safe now.</p>
<p1>As you get up you see what looks like a nice room, well kept despite seemingly abandoned for sometime, the only thing of note it a painting hung up at the far end of the entrance.</p1>
