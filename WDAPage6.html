<h1>Location: Dark Room</h1>

<p>You turn to face the ghost, and what you see before you is a woman, yet something is obscuring her eyes.</p>


"Who are you, what do you want from me!?"
<p>"<span class="Evil">Really...you don't remember? After everything you've done you just up and forget!?</span>"</p> 

**The spectre seems disappointed...**
<p>"<span class="Evil">It's ok...We have all the time in the world to make you remember...</span>" </p>**Before you could respond the room suddenly gets darker as shadows coat the far corners of the room quickly approching you, as your engulfed by the darkness you hear laughter erupt all around you the last thing you see is a smile from the sprit before everything goes dark**</p>
