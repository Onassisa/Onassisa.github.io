<h1>Location: Dark Room</h1>

<p>You run after the light, as you give chase it's changes direction, left, right, forward, backwards whichever direction it goes you follow. You don't know how long you've been running but when you came to, a door was infront of you.</p>
<p1>You enter the door, the room is cold, and dark....You feel a presence...yet you can't see anything. You can feel yourself growing colder and thats when you feel it, a sharp icey pain shoots up in your left arm you turn to the direction of that which was causing you pain, and thats when you see it....a white hand grasping your arm, you jerk your arm away ripping it from the grasps of the ghosly figure's icey grip, it's chilled touch still lingering on your being...</p1>
